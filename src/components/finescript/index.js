      While Crypto Athletes has released a roadmap outlining future goals and
      plans for community development, we cannot guarantee to accomplish every
      item outlined during the pre-launch planning phase as ideas and projects
      evolve organically. You agree that your purchase of a Hooper from our
      initial launch of 850 NFTs is all you are guaranteed to receive with your
      initial purchase, whether through primary or secondary channels. Any
      future benefits are ancillary to this purchase and not to be taken into
      consideration with your initial purchase. You agree that you are not
      relying on any future commitments by Crypto Athletes in using this site
      and participating in our NFT launch.
